# MBAN-6120-Project-1

The attached csv file has data on the fitness of pilots to fly given a number of categorical variables concerning the flight worthiness of the pilot. The target variable we want to predict is the second column “TestRes/Var1” where 1 indicates the the pilot is flight worthy, and 0 otherwise. Assume that the semantic meaning of the feature columns Var2 .. Var 6 are omitted for privacy and/or ethics reasons.
